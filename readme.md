### 2.2 Matrix-Vector Multiplication

Up to now we have used matrices to solve systems of linear equations by manipulating the rows of the
augmented matrix. In this section we introduce a different way of describing linear systems that makes
more use of the coefficient matrix of the system and leads to a useful way of “multiplying” matrices.
Vectors
It is a well-known fact in analytic geometry that two points in the plane with coordinates (a1 , a2 ) and
(b1 , b2 ) are equal if and only if a1 = b1 and a2 = b2 . Moreover, a similar condition applies to points
(a1 , a2 , a3 ) in space. We extend this idea as follows.
An ordered sequence (a1 , a2 , . . . , an ) of real numbers is called an ordered n -tuple. The word “ordered” here reflects our insistence that two ordered n-tuples are equal if and only if corresponding entries
are the same. In other words,
(a1 , a2 , . . . , an ) = (b1 , b2 , . . . , bn ) if and only if a1 = b1 , a2 = b2 , . . . , and an = bn .
Thus the ordered 2-tuples and 3-tuples are just the ordered pairs and triples familiar from geometry.
